This project was created for the IBDP (International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme) course named Information Technology in a Global Society. 

(For a limited time, the registration form and admin portal are not functioning, as they require additional effort to be moved from an online database to a local SQL file.)
Additionally, unlike the original project files, the students' names have been deleted to protect privacy.
